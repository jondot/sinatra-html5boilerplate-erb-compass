Sinatra-HTML5-Boilerplate-ERb
=============================

Joining in on the boilerplate fun, this is what I use when I don't want HAML.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jondot/sinatra-html5boilerplate-erb-compass 
    $ cd sinatra-html5boilerplate-erb-compass

In one terminal:

    $ cd public
    $ compass watch  #you need to have compass (`gem install compass`)

In another terminal

    $ bundle install
    $ rackup

Thats it.
